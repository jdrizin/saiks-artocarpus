<p>To use, select characteristics from the table at the left.  As you
make selections, items in the list of taxa on the right will turn red
to indicate that they do not match your selections.  Also as you select
characteristics, items in the table at the right will grey out to
indicate that they are not possible combinations anymore (to select
them would cause none of the taxa to match).</p>

<p>Or, you may click on a taxon at the table on the right, and all of
the characteristics of that taxon will be used to seed the
characteristics table.</p>

<p>When the "Exclusive" checkbox is checked, when you select a characteristic,
all of the other characteristics in that row will be automatically
unselected for you.  Otherwise, you may select as many characteristics
as you want in a row and it will be treated as an inclusive OR of the
criteria.</p>
