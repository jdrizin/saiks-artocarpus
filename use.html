<p>Select character states from the table at the left.  As you
make selections, taxa in the list on the right will turn red
to indicate that they do not match your selections.  Also, as you select
character states, items in the characteristics table will grey out to
indicate that they are no longer possible (no taxa would have the 
resulting combination of character states).</p>

<p>If you click on a taxon name in the table on the right, you will be taken to the
web page for this taxon.</p>

<p>If you click on "SHOW CHARS" next to a taxon name, the character states of that 
taxon will be shown in the characteristics table.</p>

<p>If you click on the "RESET" button at top left, all characters will be reset.</p>

<p>If you click on the name of a character, that character will be reset.</p>
