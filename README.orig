SLIKS-Alike Interactive Key Software (SAIKS)

Derived from Stinger's Lightweight Interactive Key Software (SLIKS)
from http://stingersplace.com/SLIKS/ by Gerald F. Guala.

SAIKS is copyright (c) 2006 Greg Alexander, to be distributed under
the terms of GPLv2 (in COPYING).

The idea is that you create a file like acer.js that contains your
dataset.  SAIKS uses the same format for this file as SLIKS does,
except that SAIKS doesn't support binary = 1.  Then you copy acer.html
to a new .html file and change it to load your data.js instead.

Note that acer.js is directly cribbed from SLIKS.

Note that there is one embrace-and-extend feature beyond SLIKS.
In SLIKS your taxon definition must match either one specific
characteristic ("1") or any of them ("?").  In SAIKS, you may
specify "23" to match characteristics 2 and 3 but not 1.  The cost
is that to use more than 9 possible selections for a characteristic,
you must use "A" for 10 (and "B" for 11, all the way to "Z" for 35),
because "10" would mean 1 or 0 instead.
